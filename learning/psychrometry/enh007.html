    <span class="SubHeading">Relative humidity (&Phi;) :</span> 
    is the ratio of the mole fraction of
    water vapor x<sub>w</sub> in a given moist air sample to the mole fraction x<sub>ws</sub>
    in an air sample, saturated at the same temperature and pressure.

    <span class="SubHeading">Dew-point temperature (T<sub>d</sub>) :</span>
    is the temperature of moist air saturated at the same pressure p, with the same humidity ratio W as 
    that of the given sample of moist air. It is defined as the solution

    <span class="SubHeading">Wet-bulb temperature (T*) : </span>
    is the temperature at which water (liquid or solid), by evaporating into moist air 
    at a given dry-bulb temperature T and humidity ratio W, can bring air to 
    saturation adiabatically at the same temperature T* while the pressure p is 
    maintained constant. This parameter is considered separately in a later 
    section.
