    this study, each set is used separately in an attempt to find solutions for the remaining
    unknown variables (2). In some cases analytical solutions were not found and numerical
    methods had to be employed. The results of different combination sets are given in Table
    6. In combination set no. 6, the properties are calculated without any numerical analysis
    procedures. In combination sets 12, 19, 27 and 33, however, numerical analysis techniques
    were employed. In the columns of Table 6, �*� following data indicates the known
    psychrometric properties. The calculated values are shown with three digits for
    comparison. However, no significant differences between any combination sets were found.<br>
