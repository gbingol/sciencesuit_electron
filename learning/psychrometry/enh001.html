<h2>Introduction</h2>
    
 <p>
     Psychrometrics deals with
    thermodynamic properties of moist air and uses these properties to analyze conditions and
    processes involving moist air.</p>
 
 <p>
    Atmospheric air contains gaseous
    components as well as water vapor and miscellaneous contaminants (e.g. smoke, pollen, and
    gaseous pollutants not normally present in free air far from pollution sources).</p>
        
<p>Dry air exists when all water vapor
    and contaminants have been removed from atmospheric air. The composition of dry air is
    relatively constant, but small variations in the amounts of individual components occur
    with time, geographic location, and altitude. 
	The relative molecular mass of all components, for <i>dry air</i> is 28.9645, and 
	the gas constant for dry air, is: R<sub>a</sub>=287.055 J/(kg.K) (1).</p>
    

<p>Moist air is a binary (or two-component) mixture of dry air and water vapor. 
	The amount of water vapor in moist air
    varies from zero (dry air) to a maximum that depends on temperature and pressure. The
    latter condition refers to saturation, a state of neutral equilibrium between moist air
    and the condensed water phase (liquid or solid). Unless otherwise stated, saturation
    refers to a flat intermolecular surface between the moist air and the condensed phase. The
    molecular weight of water is 18.01528 on the carbon-12 scale. The gas constant for water
    vapor is: R<sub>a</sub>=461.520 J/(kg.K) (1).</p>


<p>
	The temperature and barometric pressure of atmospheric air vary 
	considerably with altitude as well as with
    local geographic and weather conditions. The standard atmosphere gives a standard of
    reference for estimating properties at various altitudes. At sea level, standard
    temperature is 15&deg;C; standard barometric pressure is 101.325 kPa. The temperature is
    assumed to decrease linearly with increasing altitude throughout the troposphere (lower
    atmosphere), and to be constant in the lower reaches of the stratosphere. The lower
    atmosphere is assumed to consist of dry air that behaves as a perfect gas. Gravity is also
    assumed constant at the standard value, 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Table 1 summarizes
    property data for altitudes to 10 000 m (1).</p>
