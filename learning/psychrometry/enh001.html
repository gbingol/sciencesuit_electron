<p class="Title">INTRODUCTION</p>
    
 <p>
     Psychrometrics deals with
    thermodynamic properties of moist air and uses these properties to analyze conditions and
    processes involving moist air.
 </p>
 
 <p>
    Atmospheric air contains gaseous
    components as well as water vapor and miscellaneous contaminants (e.g. smoke, pollen, and
    gaseous pollutants not normally present in free air far from pollution sources).
    
</p>
        
<p>Dry air exists when all water vapor
    and contaminants have been removed from atmospheric air. The composition of dry air is
    relatively constant, but small variations in the amounts of individual components occur
    with time, geographic location, and altitude. The approximate percentage of dry air by
    volume can be listed as: nitrogen 78.084; oxygen, 20.9476; argon, 0.934; carbon dioxide,
    0.0314; neon, 0.001818; helium, 0.000524; methane, 0.00015; sulfur dioxide, 0 to 0.0001;
    hydrogen 0.00005; and minor components such as krypton, xenon, and ozone, 0.0002. The
    relative molecular mass of all components, for <i>dry air</i> is 28.9645, based on the
    carbon-12 scale (Harrison 1965). The gas constant for dry air, based on carbon-12 scale,
    is: R<sub>a</sub>=287.055 J/(kg.K) (1).
</p>
    

<p>Moist air is a binary (or two-component) mixture of dry air and water vapor. The amount of water vapor in moist air
    varies from zero (dry air) to a maximum that depends on temperature and pressure. The
    latter condition refers to saturation, a state of neutral equilibrium between moist air
    and the condensed water phase (liquid or solid). Unless otherwise stated, saturation
    refers to a flat intermolecular surface between the moist air and the condensed phase. The
    molecular weight of water is 18.01528 on the carbon-12 scale. The gas constant for water
    vapor is: R<sub>a</sub>=461.520 J/(kg.K) (1).
