<h2 class="head_l2">Introduction</h2>
    
 <p>
     Psychrometrics deals with
    thermodynamic properties of moist air and uses these properties to analyze conditions and
    processes involving moist air.</p>
 
 <p>
    Atmospheric air contains gaseous
    components as well as water vapor and miscellaneous contaminants (e.g. smoke, pollen, and
    gaseous pollutants not normally present in free air far from pollution sources).</p>
        
<p>Dry air exists when all water vapor
    and contaminants have been removed from atmospheric air. The composition of dry air is
    relatively constant, but small variations in the amounts of individual components occur
    with time, geographic location, and altitude. 
	The relative molecular mass of all components, for <i>dry air</i> is 28.9645, and 
	the gas constant for dry air, is: R<sub>a</sub>=287.055 J/(kg.K) (1).</p>
    

<p>Moist air is a binary (or two-component) mixture of dry air and water vapor. 
	The amount of water vapor in moist air
    varies from zero (dry air) to a maximum that depends on temperature and pressure. The
    latter condition refers to saturation, a state of neutral equilibrium between moist air
    and the condensed water phase (liquid or solid). Unless otherwise stated, saturation
    refers to a flat intermolecular surface between the moist air and the condensed phase. The
    molecular weight of water is 18.01528 on the carbon-12 scale. The gas constant for water
    vapor is: R<sub>a</sub>=461.520 J/(kg.K) (1).</p>


<p>
	The temperature and barometric pressure of atmospheric air vary 
	considerably with altitude as well as with
    local geographic and weather conditions. The standard atmosphere gives a standard of
    reference for estimating properties at various altitudes. At sea level, standard
    temperature is 15&deg;C; standard barometric pressure is 101.325 kPa. The temperature is
    assumed to decrease linearly with increasing altitude throughout the troposphere (lower
    atmosphere), and to be constant in the lower reaches of the stratosphere. The lower
    atmosphere is assumed to consist of dry air that behaves as a perfect gas. Gravity is also
    assumed constant at the standard value, 9.80665 m/s<sup>2</sup>(1).</p>

<h2 class="head_l2">Humidity Parameters Involving Saturation</h2>


<p>
    The following definitions of humidity parameters involve the concept of moist air saturation (1).</p>

<p>
    <span class="SubHeading">Humidity ratio(W) :</span> 
    (Alternatively, the moisture content or mixing ratio), W of a given moist air sample
    is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air contained in the
    sample.

    <span class="SubHeading">Mole fraction (x<sub>i</sub>) :</span> 
    The ratio of the mole number (n<sub>i</sub>) of a component (i) to the mole number of the mixture (n) is
    called the mole fraction (x<sub>i</sub>). Mole fraction of dry air, water vapour and water
    vapour at saturation are defined as x<sub>a</sub>, x<sub>w</sub>, x<sub>ws</sub> respectively. For humid air therefore,

	<span class="SubHeading">Wet-bulb temperature (T*) : </span>
	is the temperature at which water (liquid or solid), by evaporating into moist air 
	at a given dry-bulb temperature T and humidity ratio W, can bring air to 
	saturation adiabatically at the same temperature T* while the pressure p is 
	maintained constant. This parameter is considered separately in a later 
	section.

<h2 class="head_l2">Perfect Gas Relationships for Dry and Moist Air</h2>

<p>
	When moist air is considered a mixture of 
	independent perfect gases, dry air, and water vapor, each is assumed to obey the perfect 
	gas equation of state as follows: (1)</p>


<img src="equations/Image114.gif">

<p >
	where p<sub>a</sub> is partial pressure of dry air, p<sub>w</sub> is partial pressure of water vapour, 
	V is total mixture volume, n<sub>a</sub> is number of moles of dry air, n<sub>w</sub> is number of 
	moles of water vapour, R is universal gas constant (=8.31441 J/gmol K) and T is absolute temperature in K. 
	The mixture also obeys the perfect gas equation :</p>

<p>or</p>
	  
<img src="equations/Image116.gif" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="20">
	  
	  
<p>
	where P = p<sub>a</sub> + p<sub>w</sub> is the total mixture pressure and 
	n = n<sub>a</sub> + n<sub>w</sub> is the total number of moles in the mixture. 
	The mole fractions of dry air and water vapour are, respectively :</p>
	  
<img src="equations/Image117.gif" WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="36">
<img src="equations/Image118.gif" WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="36">
	  
	  
	  
	  <p >Using the equations given above, the
	  humidity ratio W and the humidity ratio of saturated air at the same temperature and
	  pressure W<sub>s</sub> are given by :</p>
	  
<img src="equations/Image119.gif" WIDTH="109" HEIGHT="40"><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="2">

	<img src="equations/Image120.gif" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="40">
<p>
	The term p<sub>ws</sub> represents the saturation pressure of
	water vapour in the absence of air at the given temperature T. This pressure p<sub>ws</sub>
	is a function only of temperature and differs slightly from the vapour pressure of water
	in saturated moist air.</p>


<p>Using relative humidity definitions,</p>
<img src="equations/Image121.gif" WIDTH="236" HEIGHT="52">

<p >
	can be obtained. Both f and m are zero for dry
	air and unity for saturated moist air. At intermediate states their values differ,
	substantially so at higher temperatures.</p>

<p>
	Enthalpy (h) : The enthalpy of a mixture of perfect gases equals the sum of the individual partial
	enthalpies of the components. Therefore, the enthalpy of moist air can be written :</p>
<img src="equations/Image122.gif" WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="20">
	  
	  
<p >
	where h<sub>a</sub> is the specific enthalpy
	for dry air and h<sub>g</sub> is the specific enthalpy for saturated water vapour at the
	temperature of the mixture. Approximately :</p>

<img src="equations/Image123.gif" WIDTH="161" HEIGHT="40">
	  
	  
<p >
	where T is the dry-bulb temperature in (&deg;C).
	The moist air enthalpy then becomes :</p>

<img src="equations/Image124.gif" WIDTH="217" HEIGHT="14">
	  
	  
<p >
	Enthalpy can be defined using wet-bulb temperature definition as :</p>
