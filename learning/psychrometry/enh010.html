    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">In the study of the
    processes of air conditioning, cold storage and drying, a knowledge of the psychrometric
    properties of the working fluid, that is humid air, is essential. In general, the
    psychrometric properties of a medium can be predicted analytically by recourse to the laws
    for gases of by consulting specially prepared charts and tables. Using these charts, if
    the atmospheric pressure or altitude is known, it is easy to find the psychrometric
    properties using two other known properties. However, during the designing, for instance,
    of a cold store, in most cases its altitude is different from sea level. And yet, most of
    the charts available in the references are based on sea level properties. Therefore,
    finding psychrometric properties from zero-altitude charts can create errors. Although the
    best method for finding these properties is to calculate them analytically using perfect
    gas relationships, in many situations, it is often neither convenient nor practical. A
    realistic solution for these problems is to employ a computer for the numerical solution
    of the relevant equations: the psychrometric properties being defined in the software.

    </font>There are seven main different properties in the psychrometric charts, namely dry-bulb,
    wet-bulb and dew-point temperatures, atmospheric pressure, humidity ratio, relative
    humidity and enthalpy (1, 2). According
    to the Gibbs Phase Rule, there are four degrees of freedom for a system consisting of
    humid air, assuming it to be a mixture of nitrogen, oxygen, and water vapor. For all
    practical purposes the ratio of the masses of oxygen and nitrogen in air is constant,
    hence the degree of freedom are reduced to three (5). Thus any three intensive properties
    will be sufficient to evaluate the remaining properties. Therefore the combination of
    three out of seven properties gives a total of 35 sets. These are shown in Table 4.<font color="#FF0000"><br>
