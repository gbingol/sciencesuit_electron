    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In the computer program, 32 out of 35
    combinations have been solved successfully. In combinations 9, 11 and 26, the equations
    could not be solved. In each of these cases, two of the equations differed only by a
    numerical factor, effectively reducing the number of free parameters and not permitting
    non trivial solutions. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A computer program was developed in JAVA for
    calculating the psychrometric properties. For 32 cases, all the properties were calculated
    with only small errors. In some cases, however especially when P was not known, a maximum
    ± 0.5%error occurred. In the other cases, errors considerably smaller than this were
    obtained. The results of different combination sets are given in Table 7. </p>
    <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When humid air is used as a working fluid,
    it is essential to use reliable data for any necessary calculations. A good method to
    perform these calculations is by the use of computer software embodying the properties of
    perfect gases. In this study such software has been developed and utilised to obtain the
    psychrometric properties of humid air. It was found that given three input parameters, the
    remaining four parameters could, except in three cases, be calculted with negligible
    error. </p>
