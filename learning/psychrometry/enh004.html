<h2>HUMIDITY PARAMETERS INVOLVING SATURATION</h2>


<p>
    The following definitions of humidity parameters involve the concept of moist air saturation (1).</p>

<p>
    <span class="SubHeading">Humidity ratio(W) :</span> 
    (Alternatively, the moisture content or mixing ratio), W of a given moist air sample
    is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air contained in the
    sample.

<p>
    <span class="SubHeading">Mole fraction (x<sub>i</sub>) :</span> 
    The ratio of the mole number (n<sub>i</sub>) of a component (i) to the mole number of the mixture (n) is
    called the mole fraction (x<sub>i</sub>). Mole fraction of dry air, water vapour and water
    vapour at saturation are defined as x<sub>a</sub>, x<sub>w</sub>, x<sub>ws</sub> respectively. For humid air therefore,

<p>
    The humidity ratio defined above W is also equal to the mole fraction ratio 
    x<sub>w</sub>/x<sub>a</sub> multiplied by the ratio of molecular masses

  <p class="Title">HUMIDITY PARAMETERS INVOLVING SATURATION</p>


  <p>The following definitions of humidity parameters involve the concept of moist air saturation (1):</p>
  
  <p>
	<span class="SubHeading">Saturation humidity ratio (W<sub>s</sub>) : </span>
  
	<br>
	
	Humidity ratio of moist air saturated with
	respect to water (or ice) at the same temperature (T) and pressure (P).
  </p>
  
  
  <p>
	<span class="SubHeading">Degree of saturation (m) : </span>
	
	<br>
	
	The ratio of the air humidity ratio W to the humidity ratio Ws 
	of saturated air at the same temperature and pressure.
  </p>
  
  <img SRC="equations/Image110.gif" alt="" />

  <p>
	<span class="SubHeading">Relative humidity (&Phi;) :</span> 
	is the ratio of the mole fraction of
	water vapor x<sub>w</sub> in a given moist air sample to the mole fraction x<sub>ws</sub>
	in an air sample, saturated at the same temperature and pressure.

	<span class="SubHeading">Dew-point temperature (T<sub>d</sub>) :</span>
	is the temperature of moist air saturated at the same pressure p, with the same humidity ratio W as 
	that of the given sample of moist air. It is defined as the solution

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  
  <p>
	<span class="SubHeading">Wet-bulb temperature (T*) : </span>
	is the temperature at which water (liquid or solid), by evaporating into moist air 
	at a given dry-bulb temperature T and humidity ratio W, can bring air to 
	saturation adiabatically at the same temperature T* while the pressure p is 
	maintained constant. This parameter is considered separately in a later 
	section.

<h2>PERFECT GAS RELATIONSHIPS FOR DRY AND MOIST AIR</h2>
<p>When moist air is considered a mixture of
independent perfect gases, dry air, and water vapor, each is assumed to obey the perfect
gas equation of state as follows: (1)</p>


<p ><img SRC="equations/Image114.gif" WIDTH="92" HEIGHT="30"></p>
	  
	  
<p >
	where p<sub>a</sub> is partial pressure of dry air, p<sub>w</sub> is partial pressure of water vapour, 
	V is total mixture volume, n<sub>a</sub> is number of moles of dry air, n<sub>w</sub> is number of 
	moles of water vapour, R is universal gas constant (=8.31441 J/gmol K) and T is absolute temperature in K. 
	The mixture also obeys the perfect gas equation :</p>
	  
<p ><img SRC="equations/Image115.gif"  WIDTH="77" HEIGHT="14"></p>
	  
	  
<p >or</p>
	  
<p ><img SRC="equations/Image116.gif" WIDTH="157" HEIGHT="20"></p>
	  
	  
<p>
	where P = p<sub>a</sub> + p<sub>w</sub> is the total mixture pressure and 
	n = n<sub>a</sub> + n<sub>w</sub> is the total number of moles in the mixture. 
	The mole fractions of dry air and water vapour are, respectively :</p>

<p ><img SRC="equations/Image118.gif" WIDTH="105" HEIGHT="36"></p>
	  
	  
	  
	  <p >Using the equations given above, the
	  humidity ratio W and the humidity ratio of saturated air at the same temperature and
	  pressure W<sub>s</sub> are given by :</p>

	<img SRC="equations/Image120.gif" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="40">
	The term p<sub>ws</sub> represents the saturation pressure of
	water vapour in the absence of air at the given temperature T. This pressure p<sub>ws</sub>
	is a function only of temperature and differs slightly from the vapour pressure of water
	in saturated moist air.</p>
